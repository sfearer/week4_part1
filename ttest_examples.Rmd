```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



## 1. Confidence intervals associated with a sample

```{r}

otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)

t.test(otter_length)


```


## 2. T-test (1-sample t-test)

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches.

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test

```


## 3.Two-sample t-test


```{r}

desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 40)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 41, 42, 46, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)

```
